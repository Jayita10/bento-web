## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) Database, or any database where you can store total user count, total server count, and global leaderboard data (perhaps per server too if you want to support dynamic routing).

### Installing the database side of Bento üç±

* Either locally run/install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or get a PostgreSQL database elsewhere. Other SQL databases may be possible considering Bento uses [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), but it is not tested and isn't recommended because the code may use PostgreSQL specific features, and it requires additional changes to the code. May be possible to use NoSQL with refactoring of code.
* The creation of the database tabels. An SQL schema file will be provided in the future, but it is possible to recreate the tables by looking through the [Sequelize-auto](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize-auto) generated models [here](https://github.com/thebentobot/bento-web/tree/master/database/models)

### Installing Bento üç± web

* ```git clone https://github.com/thebentobot/bento-web.git``` or download ZIP.
* ```npm install``` assuming you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* Create a [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) file with the environment variables: ```DBdatabase=[NAME OF YOUR DATABASE]```, ```DBusername=[NAME OF YOUR DATABASE user]```, ```DBpassword=[PASSWORD FOR YOUR DATABASE USER]``` and ```host=[IP FOR YOUR DATABASE]```

### Executing Bento üç±

* ```npm run build```
* ```npm start```
